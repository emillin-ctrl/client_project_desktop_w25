                <p>With an increased workload and difficult life transitions, graduate life can be overwhelming. However, you do not need to navigate these challenges alone.</p>
                <p>CAPS can support your mental wellbeing throughout your degree by providing accessible resources for the following:</p>
                <ul>

                    <p>While academic success and mental wellness are important for success in graduate school, it is important to acknowledge that these are built on a baseline of basic needs.</p>
                    <p>As a graduate student, a crucial resource to be aware of is the <strong>Student Life: Basic Needs</strong> resource website.</p>

                <p>Maslow's hierarchy of needs emphasizes that physiological needs like food, water, and safety must be met before you can focus on higher-level goals like academic success.</p>
